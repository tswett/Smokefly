Smokefly is inspired by Homestuck, a webcomic.  I find that reading the first four acts of Homestuck was like playing a really, really good video game.  The premise of the game is simple enough: you and some friends enter a virtual world, and must build buildings, create objects, discover hidden knowledge, and fight, in order to defeat the forces of dark and attain the Ultimate Reward.  That game doesn't currently exist, but assuming that I have an infinite amount of time and skill, Smokefly will be that game.

A smaller inspiration for Smokefly is Robin Lee Powell's thoughts on game design.  (He's one of the sanest people I know.)  Some of them can be found here:

As far as games that actually exist go, I am a fan of the philosophy behind roguelikes.  NetHack is a famous one, but it's just not great as far as game design goes.  I've heard that Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup is better.  I haven't actually played an Elder Scrolls game, but I hear that they're very good.

And all this sounds kind of silly right now (16 February 2012), since so far, I've barely started coding.
