Smokefly is a game written in Python.  Its user interface uses Pygame; if you do
not have Pygame installed, please install it.  The saving and loading of games
uses PyYAML: http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAML  To run Smokefly, run its main
module, smokefly.py.

Currently, saved games from one version won't work in future versions.

Smokefly is currently developed entirely by Tanner Swett <swettt@mail.gvsu.edu>.
Its IRC channel is #smokefly on irc.freenode.net.  Smokefly lives on Github:
