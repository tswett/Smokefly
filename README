Smokefly is a game written in Python.  Its user interface uses Pygame; if you do not have Pygame installed, please install it.  To run Smokefly, run its main module, smokefly.py.

Currently, Smokefly does not have version numbers.  It doesn't have saved games, either, but if it did, saved games from one version wouldn't work in future versions.

Smokefly is currently developed entirely by Tanner Swett <swettt@mail.gvsu.edu>.  Its IRC channel is #smokefly on irc.freenode.net.
